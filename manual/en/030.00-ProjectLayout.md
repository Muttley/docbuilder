# Project Layout

To generate a manual using the {{appname}} tool, your document source project
needs to be set up as follows:

~~~
+---docs
|   |   config.json
|   |   replacements.json
|   |
|   +---de
|   |       01.00-Section1.md
|   |       02.00-Section2.md
|   |       03.00-Section3.md
|   |
|   +---en
|   |       01.00-Section1.md
|   |       02.00-Section2.md
|   |       03.00-Section3.md
|   |
|   +---fr
|   |       01.00-Section1.md
|   |       02.00-Section2.md
|   |       03.00-Section3.md
|   |
|   \---images
|           image1.png
|           image2.png
|           image3.png
|
~~~

In the example above, the main document project folder is called `docs`.
Inside this folder is a folder called `images` which contains all the images
that will be included in the document.

To enable the support of multiple languages, versions for seperate languages
are to be kept in two-letter country code sub-directories of the main document
source directory.

These sub-directories should use the two-letter language codes as specified by
ISO 639-1[^ISO639-1].

[^ISO639-1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

Within the individual country specific folder are the localised Markdown
sections for that language.

Every `*.md` markdown file in this language sub-directory will be merged in
alphabetical order, so you can order document sections easily by giving the
files numeric prefixes.  For example:

~~~
01.00-Introduction.md
02.00-Installation.md
02.01-Linux_Install.md
02.02-Windows_Install.md
03.00-Usage.md
~~~

The actual filenames serve no purpose other than ordering, so you can name
them as you see fit as long as they are in the correct alphabetical order.

The {{appname}} tool can be used to bootstrap a document project with the
correct layout, see {{link|section:Command Line Usage}} for details.
