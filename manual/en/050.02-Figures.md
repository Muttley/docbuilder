## Figures

If you insert a title in brackets after the filename, then the image will be
used to create a figure element:

	\{{img:wat-owl.jpg(A Owl?)|scalefit:1,width:50%}}

This will result in the following Figure:

{{img:wat-owl.jpg(A Owl?)|scalefit:1,width:50%}}

**NOTE:** The Docbook stylesheet is currently configured so that Figures are
always centered on the page.
