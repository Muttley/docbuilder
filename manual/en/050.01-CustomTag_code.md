## Code Blocks

In order to provide more flexibility in the handling of code blocks, we provide
a way of handling them using a special code tag:

	\{{code:<filename>[|<language>]}}

The `<filename>` should point to a file stored in the `includes` directory of
the document source tree.

The `<language>` section is optional and is purely used to label the code block
in the generated markdown as containing that programming language. Later it is
hoped to use this to enable syntax hightlighting in the resultant PDF.

### Example 1

If you wish to embed a code block using the contents of a Perl source file, you
would use the following tag:

	\{{code:perl.pl|perl}}

Which would then create the following code block:

{{code:perl.pl|perl}}

### Example 2

Another example with no language specified:

	\{{code:javascript.js}}

This would result in the following code block being created:

{{code:javascript.js}}
