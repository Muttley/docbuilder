## Links

Due to another limitation with Pandoc, a custom tag for adding internal
document cross-references has been created:

	\{{link:<type>|<label>}}

Where `<type>` is the type of document object to link to, and `<label>` is the
label or title of the think you wish to link to.

Types of links available are `figure`, `section` and `table`.

**NOTE:** Within the three types of supported links you cannot have duplicate
names/labels, but you can however have both a Figure, Section and Table with
the title *"Command Line Parameters"* and they will not clash, etc.

### Example 1

If you wish to link to the Figure *"A Owl?"*, you would use the
following tag:

	\{{link:figure|A Owl?}}

Which would then create a cross-reference to {{link:figure|A Owl?}}.

### Example 2

If you wish to create a cross-reference to the *"Project Layout"* section, you
would use the following tag:

	\{{link:section|Project Layout}}

This would result in the following link being created:
{{link:section|Project Layout}}

### Example 3

	\{{link:table|Global Replacements}}

How about a link to a table: {{link:table|Global Replacements}}
