# Docbook Macros

The following macros have been created to allow you to have more control over
the resultant document.

## Hard Pagebreaks

The following will insert a hard pagebreak into the document, for example:

	<?hard-pagebreak?>

	This page intentionally left blank... apart from this text obviously...

Will produce the following output:

<?hard-pagebreak?>

This page intentionally left blank... apart from this text obviously...
